# TwO-O-Player-Math-Game

## About

A 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple addition problems. 

A new math question is generated each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. 

The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

If you lose all three lives, you lose the game.

Made during Lighthouse Labs (W09D1).
